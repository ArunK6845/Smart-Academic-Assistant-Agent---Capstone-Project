# Smart-Academic-Assistant-Agent---Capstone-Project
The goal of this project is to automate this entire pipeline using a coordinated multi-agent system. By delegating repetitive tasks to agents, departments can achieve faster turnaround, consistent quality, &amp; better scalability—allowing human organizers to focus on high-level event planning instead of operational tasks.
